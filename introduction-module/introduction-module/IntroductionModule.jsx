 * Mount this at /dashboard/introduction/* in your app's router, e.g.:
 *
 *   <Route path="/dashboard/introduction/*" element={<IntroductionModule />} />
 *
 * The trailing "/*" matters — this component owns its own nested <Routes>
 * for the room grid and each individual room.
 *
 * Routes this creates (relative to /dashboard/introduction):
 *   ""             -> room grid
 *   "build-tool"   -> binary exploitation room
 *   "hidden-page"  -> SQL injection room
 *   "guestbook"    -> XSS room
 *
 * All rooms are open from the start — the introduction module isn't gated
 * by progress, unlike the real dungeons later in the platform.
